EventGhost is an advanced, yet easy-to-use extensible automation tool for Windows. It can use different input devices like infrared or wireless remote controls to trigger macros, that on their part control a computer and its attached hardware.So it can be used to control a Media-PC with a normal consumer remote. But its possible uses go much beyond this.
